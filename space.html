        <h2>Space Exploration</h2>
        <p>Space exploration has allowed humanity to discover new frontiers, from landing on the Moon to sending probes beyond our solar system. NASA and private companies like SpaceX are pushing the boundaries of what we know about space.</p>
        
        <h3>The Beginnings of Space Exploration</h3>
        <p>Space exploration began during the Cold War when the United States and the Soviet Union raced to explore outer space. The first major milestone came on October 4, 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite. This event triggered the space race and led to significant advancements in space science.</p>

        <h3>Key Milestones in Space Exploration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1961:</strong> Yuri Gagarin becomes the first human to orbit Earth aboard Vostok 1.</li>
            <li><strong>1969:</strong> Apollo 11 lands Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon, with Armstrong taking humanity's first steps on the lunar surface.</li>
            <li><strong>1977:</strong> NASA launches Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 to explore the outer planets and eventually interstellar space.</li>
            <li><strong>1998:</strong> The International Space Station (ISS) is launched, providing a platform for international cooperation in space science.</li>
            <li><strong>2020s:</strong> Private companies like SpaceX begin to revolutionize space travel with reusable rockets and missions to Mars.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Modern-Day Space Exploration</h3>
        <p>Today, both government agencies like NASA and private companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Boeing are working to advance human space exploration. NASA’s Artemis program is aiming to return humans to the Moon by the mid-2020s and establish a sustainable lunar presence. SpaceX is developing the Starship, a fully reusable spacecraft intended for deep space travel, with the goal of sending humans to Mars.</p>

        <h3>What’s Next in Space Exploration?</h3>
        <p>The future of space exploration holds exciting possibilities. We could see humans on Mars within the next few decades, and NASA is planning missions to explore asteroids, distant moons like Europa (one of Jupiter’s moons), and even the outer reaches of the solar system.</p>

        <p>The rise of private companies in space exploration is also a game changer. With the development of reusable rockets, space tourism could soon be a reality for many. SpaceX has already completed successful crewed missions to the ISS, and Blue Origin aims to offer suborbital flights for civilians in the near future.</p>

        <p>The ultimate goal for space exploration is the potential for humanity to become a multi-planetary species. With advancements in technology, we may one day be able to live on other planets, such as Mars, and continue exploring the mysteries of the universe.</p>

        <h2>Pickleball</h2>
        <p>Pickleball is a fast-growing paddle sport that combines elements of tennis, badminton, and table tennis. Played with a perforated plastic ball and paddles, it takes place on a court similar in size to a badminton court, making it accessible and fun for all ages!</p>

        <h3>The History of Pickleball</h3>
        <p>Pickleball was invented in 1965 by Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum in Bainbridge Island, Washington. The game was created as a fun family activity and has since evolved into a competitive sport played worldwide. Its simple rules and social nature have made it especially popular among people of all ages.</p>

        <h3>How to Play Pickleball</h3>
        <p>The basic rules of pickleball are simple, but the game can become quite competitive. The game is typically played with two or four players. The objective is to score points by hitting the ball over a net into the opposing team's court. The ball must bounce once on each side before volleys are allowed. Players need to be mindful of the <strong>"kitchen"</strong>, a 7-foot area near the net where players cannot volley the ball.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> The ball must be served underhand and diagonally into the opponent's side of the court.</li>
            <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Points are earned only by the serving team, and the game is typically played to 11, 15, or 21 points.</li>
            <li><strong>Faults:</strong> A fault occurs when the ball is hit out of bounds, into the net, or the server breaks the rules.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Pickleball Is So Popular</h3>
        <p>Pickleball has become one of the fastest-growing sports in America due to its inclusivity and simplicity. It's easy to learn, but difficult to master, which keeps it exciting for both beginners and seasoned players. It's also a low-impact sport, making it perfect for people of all ages and fitness levels.</p>

        <p>Whether you're playing at a recreational level with friends or competing in tournaments, pickleball offers fun and exercise for all!</p>
